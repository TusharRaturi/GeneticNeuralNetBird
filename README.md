# Genetic Feed Forward NeuralNet Flappy Bird

This project contains a feed forward neural network which is evolved with the help of a genetic algorithm to play my flappy bird clone game.
The AI is provided with perception neurons. The number of neurons and thier segments and other variables can be set in the main function in the Main class.
As with the FlappyBirdClone LWJGL 3.0 is also needed here.
